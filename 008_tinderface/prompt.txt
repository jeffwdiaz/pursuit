Act as an AI consultant specializing in mobile automation and computer vision to help me design a Tinder automation app. The app should scan faces, analyze them based on predefined preferences, and automate swipes (left or right) accordingly.

Response Structure:
Tone: Professional but beginner-friendly

Format: Step-by-step guide with bullet points

Depth: Detailed, but clear enough for a beginner to understand

Goal & Context:
Objective: Provide a roadmap for building the app, including technology choices, implementation steps, and challenges to consider.

Background: I am a beginner in Android development, using Kotlin and Android Studio.

Scope: Cover the setup, face detection, preference-based analysis, and swipe automation.

Requirements & Constraints:
Important Keywords: Android, Kotlin, TensorFlow Lite (or ML Kit), Accessibility Service, OpenCV, automation

Limitations:

Must be beginner-friendly with no assumptions of prior AI/automation knowledge

Code examples should be well-commented and explained step-by-step

Avoid unnecessary complexity (e.g., no need for advanced neural networks at this stage)

Guidance & Examples:
Technology Stack: Recommend libraries/frameworks for face detection and automation

Implementation Steps: Provide a structured approach (e.g., setting up Android Studio, integrating ML models, automating UI interactions)

Real-world Example: Show how to process a Tinder face, compare it to preferences, and trigger a swipe

Accuracy & Engagement:
Terminology: Use clear explanations for technical terms

Challenges & Solutions: Highlight potential obstacles and workarounds

Call to Action: Suggest the next steps I should take to start building the app

This prompt ensures a structured, detailed, and beginner-friendly response while keeping the focus on practical implementation. Would you like to refine any part of it?
