How LLM work: Explain LLM as if I was a 6th grade/12 grader/phd
	Prediction
	Neural Networks: computational system designed to mimic human brain
	Transformers: type of neural network. It can process entire sequences of words simultaneously through a mechanism called "attention"
	Attention: allows model to weight importance of different words in a sentence. helps understand the relationship between words.

Algorithms
	Builder bots: builds algo bots
	Teacher/Test bots: tests algo bots
	Algorithm bots: best one gets chosen, rest are scrapped

Patterns in daily work life:
	
Create a diagram: create a workflow diagram that details how you'll analyze the data
	includes:
		what data goes in
		what does the ai learn from this data
		what personalized output does it create
		how do users interact with it

Children in school. Create a bot that can find the ones that need help.
