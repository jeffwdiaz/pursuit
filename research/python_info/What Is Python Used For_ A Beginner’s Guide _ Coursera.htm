Python is one of the most widely used programming languages. Learn more
about how its used for everything from machine learning to building
websites and software testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python, one of the most popular programming languages <https://
www.coursera.org/articles/popular-programming-languages> in the world,
has created everything from Netflix’s recommendation algorithm to the
software that controls self-driving cars. Python is a general-purpose
language, which means it’s designed to be used in a range of
applications, including *data science*, *software and web development*,
*automation*, and generally getting stuff done.

In this article, you'll learn more about what Python is and how it's
used in the real world. If you want to start learning this popular
programming language today, consider enrolling in the University of
Michigan's Python for Everybody Specialization <https://
www.coursera.org/specializations/python> where you'll build foundational
programming knowledge in as little as two months.

    What is Python?

Python is a computer programming language <https://www.coursera.org/gb/
articles/types-programming-language> often used to build websites and
software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a
general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of
different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. This
versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of
the most-used programming languages today.

According to a study by Statista, Python is the third most commonly used
programming language among developers worldwide [1 <https://
www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-
languages/>].

*Did you know?* The name Python comes from Monty Python. When Guido van
Rossum was creating Python, he was also reading the scripts from BBC’s /
Monty Python’s Flying Circus/. He thought the name Python was
appropriately short and slightly mysterious.

    What is Python used for?

Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task
automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively
easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as
accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like
organizing finances.

“Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says
University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance in
his book /Python for Everybody./ “You can write programs for many
reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data
analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem.”

*What can you do with Python?* Some things include:

  *

    Data analysis <https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-data-
    analysis-with-examples> and machine learning

  *

    Web development

  *

    Automation or scripting

  *

    Software testing and prototyping

  *

    Everyday tasks

Here’s a closer look at some of these common ways Python is used.


      1. Data analysis and machine learning

Python has become a staple in data science, allowing data analysts
<https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-analyst-do-a-career-
guide> and other professionals to use the language to conduct complex
statistical calculations, create data visualizations, build machine
learning algorithms <https://www.coursera.org/articles/machine-learning-
algorithms>, manipulate and analyze data, and complete other data-
related tasks.

Python can build a wide range of different data visualizations, like
line and bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, and 3D plots. Python also
has a number of libraries that enable coders to write programs for data
analysis and machine learning more quickly and efficiently, like
TensorFlow and Keras.

      2. Web development

Python is often used to develop the back end of a website or application
—the parts that a user doesn’t see. Python’s role in web development can
include sending data to and from servers, processing data and
communicating with databases, URL routing, and ensuring security. Python
offers several frameworks for web development. Commonly used ones
include Django and Flask.

Some web development jobs that use Python include**back-end engineers,
full-stack engineers, Python developers, software engineers, and DevOps
engineers.

authorization, Debugging, REST APIs, Build a data model, Design a web
application, Computer Programming, Python Programming, Application
Programming Interfaces (API), Cloud Hosting, database administration,
Database (DBMS)


      3. Software testing and prototyping

In software development, Python can aid in tasks like build control, bug
tracking, and testing. With Python, software developers can automate
testing for new products or features. Some Python tools used for
software testing include Green and Requestium.


      4. Automation or scripting

If you find yourself performing a task repeatedly, you could work more
efficiently by automating it with Python <https://www.coursera.org/
articles/python-automation>. Writing code used to build these automated
processes is called scripting. In the coding world, automation can be
used to check for errors across multiple files, convert files, execute
simple math, and remove duplicates in data.

Python can even be used by relative beginners to automate simple
computer tasks—such as renaming files, finding and downloading online
content, or sending emails or texts at desired intervals.

IT automation can be a valuable skill to add to your resume. You can
learn the basics from an industry leader in technology with the
following online program:

      5. Everyday tasks

Python isn't only for programmers and data scientists. Learning Python
can open new possibilities for those in less data-heavy professions,
like journalists, small business owners, or social media marketers.
Python can also enable non-programmers to simplify certain tasks in
their lives. Here are just a few of the tasks you could automate with
Python:

  *

    Keep track of stock market or crypto prices

  *

    Send yourself a text reminder to carry an umbrella anytime it’s raining

  *

    Update your grocery shopping list

  *

    Renaming large batches of files

  *

    Converting text files to spreadsheets

  *

    Randomly assign chores to family members

  *

    Fill out online forms automatically

      Why is Python so popular?

Python is popular for a number of reasons. Here’s a deeper look at what
makes it so versatile and easy to use for coders.

  *

    Its *simple syntax* mimics natural language, making it easier to
    read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects and
    improve on them.

  *

    It’s *versatile*. Python can be used for many different tasks, from
    web development to machine learning <https://www.coursera.org/
    articles/what-is-machine-learning>.

  *

    It’s *beginner-friendly*, making it popular for entry-level coders.

  *

    It’s *open source*, which means it’s free to use and distribute,
    even for commercial purposes.

  *

    Python’s archive of *modules and libraries*—bundles of code that
    third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is
    vast and growing.

  *

    Python has a *large and active community* that contributes to
    Python’s pool of modules and libraries, and acts as a helpful
    resource for other programmers. The vast support community means
    that if coders run into a stumbling block, finding a solution is
    relatively easy; somebody is bound to have encountered the same
    problem before.
